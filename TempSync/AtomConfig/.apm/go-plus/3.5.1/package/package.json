Install `go-plus`: `apm install go-plus` or open Atom and go to `Preferences > Packages`, search for `go-plus`, and install it\n\n## Overview\n\nThis package adds extra Atom functionality for the go language:\n\n* Autocomplete using `gocode` (you _must_ have the `autocomplete-plus` package activated for this to work)\n* Formatting source using `gofmt`, `goimports`, or `goreturns`\n* Code quality inspection using `go vet`\n* Linting using `golint`\n* Syntax checking using `go build` and `go test`\n* Display of test coverage using `go test -coverprofile`\n* Go to definition using `godef`\n\n## Example\n\n![An example of go-plus in action](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/744740/8767613/68718e22-2e1f-11e5-9e3c-afe5c23792d7.gif)\n\n## Platforms\n\nThe package is currently known to work on OS X, Windows (7+) and Ubuntu. CI jobs exist for OS X and Windows; Ubuntu CI is still in-progress.\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Defaults\n\n| Display Name                            | Name                                        | Default     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|:----------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|:------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Environment Overrides Config            | `go-plus.environmentOverridesConfiguration` | `true`      | Use the environment's value for GOPATH (if set) instead of the configured value for GOPATH (below)                                                                                                                                     |\n| GOPATH                                  | `go-plus.goPath`                            | `unset`     | You should set your GOPATH in the environment, and launch Atom using the `atom` command line tool;

You\ncan set your `GOPATH` using one of two mechanisms:\n\n* Using the environment: set the `$GOPATH` environment variable to the correct\n  value\n* Using `go-plus` preferences: set the `Go Path` preference\n\nThe environment (if set) is preferred over the `Go Path` preference by default.\nYou can change this by updating the `Environment Overrides Configuration`\npreference.\n\nThe most common reason `GOPATH` might not be set in the environment is due to the\nway OS X launches processes. When you launch Atom via processes created by\n`launchd` (e.g. using Finder, the Dock, or Spotlight) it likely will not have\naccess to your `$GOPATH` if you set it in your shell initialization files (e.g.\n`.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc).\n\nConsider launching Atom via your shell – using the Atom Shell Commands – where\nAtom should inherit your environment. Alternatively, try one of the suggestions\nat http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/87283 to set the `GOPATH` for processes\nlaunched by `launchd` (and their children, which will include Atom).\n\nSetting the `Go Path` preference will ensure that you have a sensible fallback\nfor GOPATH if you have launched Atom without the `$GOPATH` environment variable\nset.\n\nIf both the `Go Path` preference and the `$GOPATH` / `%GOPATH%` environment variable are\nempty, `go-plus` will display a warning and will not perform `go build` / `go\ntest` powered syntax checking.\n\n## Planned Features\n\nThe following features will be added soon:\n\n* `godoc` integration ([#12](https://github.com/joefitzgerald/go-plus/issues/12))\n* `gb` support\n* go `vendor experiment` support\n* `gorename` integration ([#174](https://github.com/joefitzgerald/go-plus/issues/174))\n* ... and others: https://github.com/joefitzgerald/go-plus/issues\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### GOPATH\n\n> <b>Question:</b> Why can't Atom see my GOPATH? I have set it and I see it in terminal?\n\n> <b>Answer:</b> Did You Launch Atom Using The Shell Command?\n\n(From Above):\n\nThe most common reason `GOPATH` might not be set in the environment on OS X is due to the way OS X launches processes. When you launch Atom via processes created by `launchd` (e.g. using Finder, the Dock, or Spotlight) it likely will not have access to your `$GOPATH` if you set it in your shell initialization files (e.g. `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc).\n\nConsider launching Atom via your shell – using the Atom Shell Commands – where Atom should inherit your environment. Alternatively, try one of the suggestions at http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/87283 to set the `GOPATH` for processes launched by `launchd` (and their children, which will include Atom).\n\n### Still Having Issues?\n\nIf you are having issues and the information above isn't helping, feel free to create an issue at https://github.com/joefitzgerald/go-plus/issues.
